Below is a *ready‑to‑paste* outline for a high‑converting landing page, followed by a brief note on **why each section exists and why it appears where it does**.
Feel free to keep, drop, or rearrange items, but this flow reflects proven conversion‑rate‑optimization patterns for B2B SaaS and the recruiter persona you’re targeting.

## 1 · Hero / Value Proposition

**Headline**
**Stop Drowning in Resumes — Surface Your Top 10 Candidates in Seconds**

**Sub‑headline**
MatchAGig uses AI to read every resume, rank the best fits, and auto‑generate tailored summaries and emails, so you spend more time placing talent and less time sifting PDFs.

**Primary CTA**

## 2 · Pain Amplifier

> **“I opened 532 applications for one role last week. I scanned resumes until midnight and still wasn’t sure I’d found the best match.”**
> — *Senior Agency Recruiter*

**Recognize these headaches?**

| Old Way                                  | Result                           |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Manual keyword searches miss hidden gems | Great candidates slip through    |
| Copy‑pasting profiles into emails        | Hours lost on repetitive writing |
| Vague client feedback                    | You can’t prove fit fast enough  |

Problem‑statement CTA: `Show me the fix →`

### Why This Order Works

1. **Hero** immediately promises a concrete win (“surface top 10 candidates”) and orients the visitor.
2. **Pain Amplifier** mirrors the recruiter’s daily frustration, building emotional urgency before any features are shown.
3. **Instant Proof** removes skepticism fast—visual evidence that the promise is real.
4. **Core Benefits** translate pain into clear, numbers‑backed outcomes and introduce security early (a common blocker).
5. **Social Proof** leverages authority bias; proof that peers already succeed with the product increases trust.
6. **Workflow Section** reassures visitors it plugs into their day without extra work—crucial for adoption.
7. **Tech Accordion** caters to evaluators who need technical depth without cluttering the main flow.
8. **Beta Invitation** uses scarcity + incentive to compel immediate action. Placed after proof, so the ask feels safe.
9. **Trust Footer** alleviates final objections (legal, security) right where credit‑card or data worries arise.

Use this structure as a launch pad, then A/B‑test headlines, imagery, and CTAs to maximize recruiter conversion.
