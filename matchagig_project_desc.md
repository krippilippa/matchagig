# MatchAGig.ai Project Description & Context

## 📌 Overview
MatchAGig.ai is an AI-powered platform concept aimed at recruiters, hiring managers, and potentially job seekers. It would allow users to upload resumes, automatically parse and structure these resumes, and then instantly match them against any given job description. The platform concept is initially validated through a landing page designed to gauge recruiter interest. Recruiters would eventually have options to protect their uploaded candidate data (paid feature) and to view expanded candidate information from a shared database (also a paid feature).

## 🎯 Goals & Validation
Right now, MatchAGig.ai aims purely to validate market demand by launching a landing page to capture sign-ups for a beta program. Actual tool development will depend entirely on interest validation results. This validation involves:
- Quickly determining recruiter interest globally.
- Capturing potential beta testers and early users.
- Collecting user insights via optional questionnaires during sign-up.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack (Conceptual)
If developed, the solution would leverage modern, flexible tools:
- **Frontend:** Built using AI-assisted tools like Cursor or Lovable, ensuring rapid prototyping and professional quality.
- **Backend:** Supabase (a serverless, PostgreSQL-based platform) to store recruiter and candidate data efficiently and securely.
- **Automation & Integration:** n8n for workflow automation, seamlessly connecting Supabase to email outreach and CRM tools like Apollo.
- **AI Integration:** GPT models (e.g., GPT-4) for intelligent parsing, structuring of resume data, and semantic matching.
- **Vector Database:** Pinecone or Chroma to manage and query resume and job description embeddings efficiently.

## 💡 Core Features (Planned)
- **Resume Parsing:** Uses GPT-4 to accurately and semantically parse and structure resume data, ignoring irrelevant graphical elements (logos, charts, etc.).
- **Instant Semantic Matching:** Match structured resumes with job descriptions, providing top candidate matches within seconds.
- **Candidate Protection:** Paid feature allowing recruiters to protect visibility of their uploaded resumes.
- **Candidate Discovery:** Paid access enabling recruiters to view detailed candidate information from a shared database.

## 📧 User Flow (Landing Page Validation)
- Users visit the landing page, clearly understand the platform concept benefits, and sign up for beta.
- Data collected: Email, Name, Company, Role, Key Pain Points (optional).
- User sign-ups trigger automated workflows in n8n, moving data from Supabase to CRM/email tools (Apollo).

## 🚀 Future Expansions (Conceptual)
If validated, the platform would later expand to cater equally to both recruiters and job seekers, offering broader services such as candidate profiling, job recommendations, career guidance, and broader hiring functionalities.

## 🎨 Brand & Tone
- Professional yet approachable tone.
- Clearly communicates ease of use, speed, and reliability.
- Neutral branding suitable for both employers and candidates.

This document provides clear context, technical framework, and strategic goals for guiding the creation of an effective landing page intended purely for initial market validation. Actual tool development will only proceed if sufficient interest is validated.
